# BuilderHub — Community Learning & Build Platform

**BuilderHub** is a beginner-friendly, community-driven tech learning platform built by members of the Zone01Kisumu coding community. The goal is simple: learn by building real software together.

This project helps new and growing developers move from theory to practical skills through collaboration, guided learning, and hands-on contribution to a real-world platform.

We believe the best way to learn tech is to build tech, together.

# Project Vision

BuilderHub exists to:

* Help beginners learn programming through real project work
* Encourage collaborative development habits early
* Teach Git, code reviews, documentation, and teamwork
* Provide a safe and supportive entry point into software engineering
* Build a useful platform for learners to track progress and access resources

This is not a tutorial project — it is a **living community product**.

# What We Are Building

A web-based learning hub where users can:

* Create accounts
* Track learning progress
* Access curated beginner resources
* Join study groups
* Attempt coding challenges
* Submit mini-projects
* Get peer feedback
* View community updates and events

The platform will grow in phases, starting simple and expanding over time.

# Tech Stack (Initial)

We start simple and practical:

**Frontend**

* React
* HTML/CSS
